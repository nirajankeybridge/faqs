This is most likely due to separation distances that are mandated in addition to the protection contours.

#### What are protected contours?

A contour within which a station and its associated receivers or remote stations have protection from other devices operating in the same frequency bands and which might interfere with the station.There are contours around transmitters inside of which the transmitter is entitled to protection from interference. Contours are determined as described in [DBS-01 Section 9.2](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s9.2) and [DBS-01 Annex B - Determination of the TV Broadcast Protected Contour](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#sB)

#### What is a separation distance \(SD\)?

In addition to the contours, additional separation distance are mandated in order to protect customers who are at the edge of the contour.

The separation distances are outlined in DBS-01 sections [9.3](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s9.3), [10](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s10), [11](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s11), and [12](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s12)

Details regarding how separation distances are calculated are available in [DBS-01 Annex C â€” Methodology on the Derivation of the Required Separation Distance to the TV Broadcast and RRBS Contours](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#sC)
