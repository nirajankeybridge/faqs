This is most likely due to separation distances.

What is a separation distance \(SD\)?

There are contours around transmitters inside of which the transmitter is entitled to protection from interference. Contours are determined as described in DBS-01 Annex B - Determination of the TV Broadcast Protected Contour

In DBS-01 sections 9.3, 10, 11, and 12, separation distances required around each station are delineated. There are some mandated separation distances from actual contour, and not up to the contour, in order to protect customers who are at the edge of the contour.
