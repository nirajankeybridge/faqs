Key Bridge WSDBA and Industry Canada can work together to help you in analyzing the interference.

[Section 12.2 on Interference Resolution Procedures](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10927.html#s12.2) found at the following link is excerpted below:  [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10927.html\#s12.2](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10927.html#s12.2)

> **12.2 Interference Resolution Procedures**
>
> In cases of harmful interference to authorized radio systems or services suspected to be caused by a WSD, the radio user experiencing such interference should report the problem to its nearest ISED Canada Spectrum Management office.A list of [ISED Canada’s offices](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01742.html) is provided in Radiocommunication Information Circular RIC-66, available at [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01742.html](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01742.html).
>
> In accordance with the [Radiocommunication Act](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/R-2/FullText.html), harmful interference is defined as “an adverse effect of electromagnetic energy from any emission, radiation or induction that \(a\) endangers the use or functioning of a safety-related radiocommunication system, or \(b\) significantly degrades or obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts, the use or functioning of radio apparatus or radio-sensitive equipment.”
>
> The procedure for investigating suspected harmful interference to authorized radiocommunication systems is set out in Section 4 of [ISED Canada’s Spectrum Management Service Standards](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08802.html). A copy of the [Service Standards](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08802.html) is at [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08802.html](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08802.html).
>
> After confirming that the source of interference is a particular WSD, the Department may issue to the operator of the device a notice pursuant to paragraph 5\(1\)\(l\) of the Radiocommunication Act to cease or modify operation of this device immediately.
>
> Should the operator of the interference-causing WSD fail to comply with this noticeand/oris found to benon-compliantwith technical requirements outlined in [Radio Standards Specification RSS-222](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10930.html), ISED Canada will require the device owner to immediately cease operation of the device in question. In this case, the Department may also require the WSDBA, upon receipt of a written request from ISED Canada, to cease to provide available channels to the interference-causing device.
>
> ISED Canada will require the WSDBA to take appropriate corrective action to resolve interference concerns linked to the following:
>
> * operating problems or deficiencies of a designated WSDB; and/or
> * a designated WSDB’s failure to meet technical or operational requirements as set out in DBS-01

To aid with the investigation, log files are maintained regarding WSD registrations for at least 60 days.

Additionally, Industry Canada can also unauthorize use of certain channels by certain WSDs.

[Section 18 of the DBS-01 — White Space Database Specifications](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s18) is as follows:

> ## 18. Interference Response
>
> Interference response remains Industry Canada’s responsibility. In order to facilitate this, a WSDB shall:
>
> 1. Retain logs of WSD queries and responses for sixty \(60\) days to allow for audits in the case of interference reports. This information shall be provided to Industry Canada following a formal request by the Department; and
> 2. Be capable of indicating, upon request by Industry Canada, that no channels are available when queried by a specific WSD or mode of WSDs. This capability is to be implemented such that a mode of a WSD, or all WSDs, can also be denied to channels on the basis of a geographic area defined by a point and radius, or by a quadrilateral defined by straight lines connecting four geographic points.

However, on-the-ground enforcement is out of scope for WSDBA.
