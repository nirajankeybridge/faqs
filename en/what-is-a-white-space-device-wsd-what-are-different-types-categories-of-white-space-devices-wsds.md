**White Space Device \(WSD\):**

A radio apparatus that operates in the WS frequency bands using dynamic spectrum access techniques.

**Fixed WSD:** A device that transmits and/or receives radiocommunication signals at a specified fixed location. The fixed device selects potential operational frequencies from a list of available channels, as provided by a WSDB.

**Personal/Portable WSD: **A personal/portable WSD is a device that transmits and/or receives radiocommunication signals while stationary or in motion at unspecified fixed points.

**Mode I Personal/Portable Device: **A personal/portable WSD that does not use an internal geolocation capability and does not directly access a WSDB to obtain a list of available radio frequency channels.

A mode I personal/portable device must obtain a list of available channels on which it may operate through an indirect connection via either a fixed device or a mode II personal/portable device. A mode I personal/portable device does not initiate a network of WSDs nor provide a list of available radio frequency channels to another mode I device for use by such a device.

**Mode II Personal/Portable Device: **A personal/portable WSD that uses internal geolocation and accesses a WSDB for a list of available radio frequency channels.

Access to the database may be through a direct connection to the Internet or through an indirect connection via a fixed or other mode II WSD. A mode II device may provide its lists of available radio frequency channels to another mobile device for use by that device.
