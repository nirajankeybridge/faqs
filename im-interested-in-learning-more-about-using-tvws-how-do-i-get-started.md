Thank you for your interest in TV white space. Please familiarize with the following for the basics.

**Dynamic Spectrum Access: **A technique by which a radio system dynamically adapts to the local radio spectrum environment in order to determine — and then access — available channels at specific locations.

**White Space \(WS\): **Part of the spectrum that is, or has become, available for radiocommunication by radio systems at a specific time period and in a given geographical area.

**White Space Database \(WSDB\): **An Industry Canada-recognized third party database that maintains records of all licensed services and systems approved to operate within WS frequency bands. The WSDB determines available channels at a specific time and geographic location, and provides lists of available channels to WSDs.

**White Space Database Administrator \(WSDBA\): **A third party service provider designated by Industry Canada to administer a WSDB within Canada.

**White Space Device \(WSD\): **A radio apparatus that operates in the WS frequency bands using dynamic spectrum access techniques.
