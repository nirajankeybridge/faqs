Key Bridge WSDBA and Industry Canada can work together to help you in analyzing the interference.

To aid with the investigation, log files are maintained regarding WSD registrations for at least 60 days. Additionally, Industry Canada can also unauthorize use of certain channels by certain WSDs.

[Section 18 of the DBS-01 — White Space Database Specifications](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s18) states:

> ## 18. Interference Response
>
> Interference response remains Industry Canada’s responsibility. In order to facilitate this, a WSDB shall:
>
> 1. Retain logs of WSD queries and responses for sixty \(60\) days to allow for audits in the case of interference reports. This information shall be provided to Industry Canada following a formal request by the Department; and
> 2. Be capable of indicating, upon request by Industry Canada, that no channels are available when queried by a specific WSD or mode of WSDs. This capability is to be implemented such that a mode of a WSD, or all WSDs, can also be denied to channels on the basis of a geographic area defined by a point and radius, or by a quadrilateral defined by straight lines connecting four geographic points.
