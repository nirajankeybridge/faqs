Key Bridge WSDBA and Industry Canada can work together to help you in analyzing the interference.

[Section 12.2 on Interference Resolution Procedures](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10927.html#s12.2) found at the following link is excerpted below:  [http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10927.html\#s12.2](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10927.html#s12.2)

12.2 Interference Resolution Procedures

In cases of harmful interference to authorized radio systems or services suspected to be caused by a WSD, the radio user experiencing such interference should report the problem to its nearest Industry Canada Spectrum Management office.

In accordance with the [Radiocommunication Act](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/R-2/FullText.html), harmful interference is defined as “an adverse effect of electromagnetic energy from any emission, radiation or induction that \(a\) endangers the use or functioning of a safety-related radiocommunication system, or \(b\) significantly degrades or obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts, the use or functioning of radio apparatus or radio-sensitive equipment.”

The procedure for investigating suspected harmful interference to authorized radiocommunication systems is set out in Section 4 of Industry Canada’s Spectrum Management Service Standards.



After confirming that the source of interference is a particular WSD, the Department may issue to the operator of the device a notice pursuant to paragraph 5\(1\)\(l\) of the Radiocommunication Act to cease or modify operation of this device immediately.



Should the operator of theinterference-causingWSD fail to comply with this noticeand/oris found to benon-compliantwith technical requirements outlined in Radio Standards Specification RSS-222, Industry Canada will require the device owner to immediately cease operation of the device in question. In this case, the Department may also require the WSDBA, upon receipt of a written request from Industry Canada, to cease to provide available channels to theinterference-causingdevice.



Industry Canada will require the WSDBA to take appropriate corrective action to resolve interference concerns linked to the following:



operating problems or deficiencies of a designated WSDB;

and/or

a designated WSDB’s failure to meet technical or operational requirements as set out in

DBS-01



To aid with the investigation, log files are maintained regarding WSD registrations for at least 60 days.

Additionally, Industry Canada can also unauthorize use of certain channels by certain WSDs.

However, on-the-ground enforcement is currently out of scope for WSDBA.

[Section 18 of the DBS-01 — White Space Database Specifications](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s18) is as follows:

> ## 18. Interference Response
>
> Interference response remains Industry Canada’s responsibility. In order to facilitate this, a WSDB shall:
>
> 1. Retain logs of WSD queries and responses for sixty \(60\) days to allow for audits in the case of interference reports. This information shall be provided to Industry Canada following a formal request by the Department; and
> 2. Be capable of indicating, upon request by Industry Canada, that no channels are available when queried by a specific WSD or mode of WSDs. This capability is to be implemented such that a mode of a WSD, or all WSDs, can also be denied to channels on the basis of a geographic area defined by a point and radius, or by a quadrilateral defined by straight lines connecting four geographic points.
