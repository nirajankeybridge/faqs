#### 7.2.1 Fixed WSD Registration

A WSDB shall provide a registration facility for fixed WSD users served by the WSDB. This information is to be collected from the users to facilitate investigations in the event that harmful interference occurs.

A WSDB shall collect the following information from fixed WSD users:

1. Name of the individual or business that owns the device \(e.g. the Internet Service Provider \(ISP\) providing the service not the ISP's customers\);
2. Name of a contact person responsible for resolving interference issues related to the device's operation;
3. Mailing address for the contact person;
4. Valid email address for the contact person; and
5. Phone number for the contact person.

The registration information shall be considered public.

Prior to registering a WSD for the first time, a WSDB shall verify that the above-mentioned information for the registration is complete and that a verified email address has been provided by the fixed WSD user.
