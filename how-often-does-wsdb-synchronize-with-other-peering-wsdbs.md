This is outlined in [Section 15 of DBS-01 — White Space Database Specifications](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10928.html#s15) as follows:

> ## 15. Synchronization
>
> \(ii\) A WSDB shall ensure that the registration information of the fixed WSD sites, TV receive sites, cable TV head-ends, and scheduling information of licensed LPA sites is synchronized with the other designated Canadian WSDBs, as well as with any U.S. WSDBs identified by Industry Canada at least every 15 minutes.
>
> This provision will depend on the outcome of cross-border negotiations with the U.S. During those negotiations, Industry Canada will consider and minimize any resulting burden on Canadian databases.
